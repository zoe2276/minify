# minify
A mini-player for Spotify to control audio playback without needing the full-sized window.
Currently in an early alpha state. DM me on Discord if you'd like current build instructions to try it out yourself.

## Current State
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/aukohKFS/minify)
A lot of the currently-playing information and handling has been implemented. 
However, the seek functionality is a tad chaotic -- it will send many more calls to the endpoint than is needed.
